## **General Information**

**Skills inventory systems** are a type of human resources management tool that helps organizations keep track of the skills and knowledge of their employees. These systems typically involve creating a database of employee information, which can include job titles, job duties, and training and education history. This information is then used to create a skills matrix, which is a visual representation of the skills and knowledge possessed by each employee. The skills matrix allows managers to quickly and easily identify areas where employees may need additional training or development, and to match employees with tasks and projects that align with their strengths and expertise.

One of the main benefits of **skills inventory systems** is that they allow organizations to optimize the use of their human capital. By knowing what skills and knowledge their employees have, managers can ensure that they are assigning tasks and projects to the right people, which can help to increase efficiency and productivity. Additionally, skills inventory systems can help organizations identify employees who may be suitable for promotion or transfer to other departments or roles within the organization.

Overall, skills inventory systems can be an invaluable tool for organizations looking to manage their human resources effectively and ensure that their employees are able to contribute to the organization's goals and objectives.
